This is an unofficial LaTeX2e style and template for the International
Astronautical Congress (IAC). I took some liberties from the version
distributed by the IAF secretariat.

I have not yet dealt with the citations, but the IAC doesn't provide any
bibliography guidelines.

Feel free to use or modify this template, but please consider it to be
distributed under the BSD 2-clause license. In other words, don't remove
the attribution or this README.
